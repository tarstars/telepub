<h1>How to find linear superposition in chaos</h1>
<p>Now we have a set of points which, while fairly random from a mathematical point of view, give us a depiction of the “Extra Boost” sign. For my method, I need to find several groups, each represented by a linear combination of basis functions. I set time \(t\) to go from left to right, from 0 to 1. The basis functions are \([1,\, t,\, \sin(kt),\, \cos(kt)]\), so the extrapolating function is</p>

<p>Weights \(A,B,C,D\) can be estimated from the dataset using least squares, but we still need to pick \(k\). After a set of experiments I chose \(k=50\): it gives a convenient scale—the wavelength is roughly the width of a letter.</p>
<p>With this setup I obtained the picture you see at the beginning of the article. Then I decided the tolerance was too large and reduced the band width.</p>
<p>Here we are: a narrow band.</p>

<p>Next, I removed points within the tolerance range and repeated the process. To my surprise, after the first iteration nothing changed.</p>

<p>You can see that the dots disappeared, but the curve didn’t change. After a while I understood why. It was vibe-coding: I asked my iron friend to find a curve that captures the highest number of points; instead, it wrote code that <strong>minimizes MSE</strong>. That approach has an interesting property: when you delete points lying on the curve, the MSE is unchanged, so the same curve remains optimal.</p>
<p>I told the iron friend that, instead of minimizing squared distance to the points, it should <strong>maximize the number of captured points</strong>. It proposed the <strong>RANSAC</strong> approach, which was new to me: repeatedly select four random points, fit the curve, count captured points, and keep the candidate with the most inliers. It worked.</p>

<p>I ran the process iteratively, and it decomposed the figure into a superposition of functions. Unfortunately, the upper half of “B” wasn’t captured. I suspected the issue was the different heights of lowercase and uppercase letters and created a second version of the drawing.</p>

<p>The same procedure gave me the sign decomposed into <strong>eight</strong> components, each a superposition of the basis functions.</p>

<p>Finally, I encoded the group number as a 0–1 vector of static features \(f<em>1,f</em>2,f_3\) and exported the dataset as CSV. Hooray — now we have data to test the <strong>MSE mode</strong> of the EXTRA BOOST model.</p>
