<p><strong>Forging the Algorithm</strong>
Arseniy</p>
<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>
<p>In earlier posts I talked about my time at Equifax, where I encountered instability in credit-scoring models. I outlined the main ideas behind feature engineering and target construction for this task, and I wrote the largest PL/SQL script I’ve ever written.</p>
<p><strong>Forging an Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>After a while I joined HeadHunter. Things stabilized and the work began. Two or three times a week, after a full day at the office, I would travel from Alekseevskaya to Park Kultury in Moscow (about 45 minutes). There, my friend and I worked on gradient-boosted decision trees with extrapolation. We started by deriving the standard gradient-boosted decision-trees algorithm.</p>
<p>The core procedure is splitting. Let’s unpack it step by step. First, we need to choose a loss function to minimize. Suppose our model produces a score <img class="eq-inline" src="/telepub/assets/eq-1476244d6bcc.svg" alt="s_i" data-tex="s_i"> for object <img class="eq-inline" src="/telepub/assets/eq-042dc4512fa3.svg" alt="i" data-tex="i"> whose true label is <img class="eq-inline" src="/telepub/assets/eq-35c2ac2f82d0.svg" alt="y_i" data-tex="y_i">. The loss for this object is <img class="eq-inline" src="/telepub/assets/eq-224b1efe0122.svg" alt="l(s_i, y_i)" data-tex="l(s_i, y_i)">, and the total loss is <img class="eq-inline" src="/telepub/assets/eq-1fb382745a7c.svg" alt="L=\sum_{i=1}^{n} l(s_i, y_i)" data-tex="L=\sum_{i=1}^{n} l(s_i, y_i)">.</p>
<figure class="eq"><img src="/telepub/assets/eq-4df71b1494e2.svg" alt="\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(s_\theta(x_i), y_i)" data-tex="\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(s_\theta(x_i), y_i)"></figure>
